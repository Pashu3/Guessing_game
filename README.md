**Guess the Number Game**
This is a simple Python script where the player needs to guess a random number between 1 and 10.

**Getting Started**
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
Clone or download the script to your local machine.
**Usage**
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
**Run the script by executing the following command:**
python guess_the_number.py
Enter your name when prompted.
Guess the number by entering an integer between 1 and 10.
The script will provide feedback on whether your guess is correct, too high, or too low.
You have three attempts to guess the correct number.
If you guess the number correctly, the script will display a congratulatory message with the number of attempts you took.
If you do not guess the number correctly within three attempts, the script will reveal the correct number and end the game.
**Example**
Name of the player: John
Guess the number between 1 to 10: 5
The guess is greater than the number! Try again...
Guess the number between 1 to 10: 2
Hurray!
Mr/Ms/Mrs John... You have guessed the right number in 2 attempts and it's 2.
